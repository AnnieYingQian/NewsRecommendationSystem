# NewsRecommendationSystem
This is a real time news scraping and recommendation system. The system uses a news pipeline to scrape latest news from various of sources such CNN, BBC. To render the news, I built a single-page web application using React. In addition, in order to customize news list for users, I designed and built a training pipeline for news topic modeling using Tensorflow.
